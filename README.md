Designed and implemented an automated fire system where the system accurately detects early fire hazards by analyzing real-time data from sensors and cameras providing immediate alerts. 
The project focused on improving response times and false alarms, leading to an efficient, reliable detection system with close to 85% accuracy. 
Tools used: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV (Haar Cascade model), Streamlit
